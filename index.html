        <h3>Objectives/Goals</h3>
          <p>
            I grew up going to multiple schools spending most of my education at Garden Spot in New Holland, Pennsylvania. Throughout my education I picked up major skills in Math, English, and a minor in Computer Programming during High School. I have moved on to an enrollment of Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology in Lancaster, and I am currently enrolled in Computer Software Engineering Technology. Though I have no work experience as of yet I am very passionate of this career and hope to pursue it for many years to come. It would be my dream and passion to work for a company that will gracefully allow me to gain experience whilst I work. I hope to ensure a place not only in the company, but in the employees as a beneficial and reliable friend.

        <h4>Company: Zerbe Sisters Nursing Center</h4>
        <p>
          In the past summer jobs, I had applied to work for a retirement home known as Zerbe Sisters. Though it has gone through many changes since I had left, I did leave on great terms on which I could return to the job if I pleased. For work experience I worked on everything kitchen and dinner related services, and I did all of it to the fullest. I was considered equal to my superiors and was highly remarked from my co-workers.

          From my work experience I have picked up a lot on team communication and co-operation. I work well to try and please others, focussing on representing the efficiency of my squad as a whole. I learned to prevent laziness, procrastination, and imediately focus on getting the job done right the first time. I even adapt well to new surroundings very easily.
